## Description
This project is designed to parse C++ code and generate flowcharts in Microsoft Visio. It leverages the power of parsing C++ code to identify control structures, functions, and variables, and represents them graphically as flowchart elements in Visio. The generated flowchart provides a visual representation of the program's logic and control flow, aiding in understanding and analyzing complex codebases.

## Features
- Parses C++ code to identify control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) and functions.
- Extracts variables and their relationships within the code.
- Generates a flowchart in Visio with appropriate symbols and connections representing the code's control flow.
- Supports various control structures, including if-else statements, loops, switch statements, and function calls.
- Allows customization of flowchart elements and styling in Visio.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Beta-Blaze/block_shemaA.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure Visio API credentials and connection details (if applicable).
4. Set up the C++ code parser module (if provided separately).
5. Ensure the required versions of Microsoft Visio and related software are installed.

## Usage
1. Open the C++ code parsing and flowchart generation tool.
2. Provide the path to the C++ source code file you want to parse.
3. Initiate the parsing process, allowing the tool to analyze the code and generate the flowchart.
4. Once the parsing is complete, the flowchart will be automatically opened in Microsoft Visio.
5. Customize the flowchart appearance, layout, and styling as desired using the Visio interface.
6. Save the flowchart for future reference or export it in a suitable format (e.g., PNG, PDF).
